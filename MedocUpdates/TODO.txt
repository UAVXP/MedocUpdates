MedocInternal.cachedVersion - this needs to be removed when we will be able to download and run updates
	Or better should be the way to force update (invalidate) this

Logging every operation (like parsing, checking for updates, etc.)
	+Write log message level at the log line into the log itself

+Compile under the lowest .NET Framework (.NET Framework 4.7.2) as possibly as I can get
	Not needed, the server supports that

+Convert Log class to static one?

+Log/MedocTelegram app args extraction to external class (ParsedArgs)
+Storage Telegram token in SessionStorage
+Be able to set log level and Telegram token from the UI (app args ones will be just needed to override those)

+Use string version only at the MedocVersion variable initializing
"Disable all notifications" setting
Various notifications control (enable/disable)
Rename "Delay notifications" to "Checking updates interval"
Make updates to M.E.Doc server through the keyboard button in Telegram message
	When someone pressed the button - it should be disabled/removed from other subscribers (or just does nothing on press)
	+Update installation program needs to be operated
	Make a button that will download all of the needed .zip-files from the downloads

+Need to get previous update_*.log, if the latest one doesn't contain DSTVERSION in it. Also should do it recursively
+Setting for downloads folder - to download and run updates immediately through the application

+Callback on Internet connection became online

+Settings: Enable/disable .upd file removing after update installation
+Application should notice the user that M.E.Doc hasn't been updated or installed
	-Or just assume that M.E.Doc version that has been installed (and not updated) - is the latest from the downloads' page Distribution section
		Could be wrong! Then ask user, what version he'd been installed
	+Latest installed distribution (not update) version is stored at HKLM\HKCU\Software\M.E.Doc\M.E.Doc subkey

+Need to detect cancelled update
	Doesn't actually need to, made proper update detection

Make an app updater
+Build number things

+Leave only one app instance to run
+"Run minimized" setting
	"-minimize" command-line parameter
?"Repeat notifications" setting
Make guardian app, that will run the main app and store stdout/stderr output (like a batch file doing it now)

+When updates are performing, do something with user be possible to Check for updates and frick up the buttons

+Small "first run" form (or wizard), where user can define some of the important settings
Localization
	First - the interface
	Second - logs (maybe)
	Loc.Get should have 2nd parameter that defines a default string, if none of the localization file is available
	+Check for empty token in lang files and don't add them - they will act like a comments
	Manually fix duplicate lang entries (i.e. for frmSettings and frmFirstRun)
	+Force localization command-line parameter
		All is okay, if choosed forcelanguage doesn't exist - program logs this out and continues with the saved one language
	+Check what happens if one of Loc.Get would have forced lang set to unknown language

?Replace "string.Trim().Length <= 0" with the "string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace"
?Replace MedocVersion with Version
	Probably, if I will, I'll do this internally in MedocVersion, for comparison only

Store userIDs in a separate file
+Telegram updates message should contain links to the changelogs
Change download progressbar color (or even hightlighted DownloadButton background)
