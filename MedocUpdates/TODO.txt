MedocInternal.cachedVersion - this needs to be removed when we will be able to download and run updates
	Or better should be the way to force update (invalidate) this

Logging every operation (like parsing, checking for updates, etc.)
+Compile under the lowest .NET Framework (.NET Framework 4.7.2) as possibly as I can get

+Setting for downloads folder - to download and run updates immediately through the application

		Could be wrong! Then ask user, what version he'd been installed

+Need to detect cancelled update
